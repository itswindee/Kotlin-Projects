# Kotlin Projects

I have created a repository that allows me to store all of my Kotlin projects in one place. This is so that my GitHub looks more organized and neat, and this will also allow recruiters and other developers to view projects easily on my page. :)

Each project will have their own README.md file that describes what the project is doing. I will be working on writing all of them!

**NOTE:** This repository consists of both personal projects and projects I have worked in class.
